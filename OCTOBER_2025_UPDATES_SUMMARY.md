## 🆕 Phase 6: Sales Commissions System

### What Was Created:

**A complete new system for tracking salesperson commissions with automatic profit calculations.**

### Key Components:

#### 1. Database Tables (2 new):

**salespersons** (7 fields):
- id, name, email, phone
- default_commission_rate (%)
- status (Active/Inactive)
- notes

**sales_commissions** (16 fields):
- id, order_number, invoice_number, invoice_date
- salesperson_id, salesperson_name
- total_order_amount, product_cost_amount
- company_profit_percentage, company_profit_amount
- net_supplier_cost
- salesperson_commission_percentage, salesperson_commission_amount
- company_net_profit
- status, notes

#### 2. Pre-loaded Data:

**4 Salespersons**:
- Lily (2.5% commission)
- Ruby (3.0% commission)
- Nikos (2.5% commission)
- External Partner A (3.5% commission)

#### 3. Web Interface (`sales-commissions.html`):

**Features**:
- ✅ Dashboard with 5 summary cards
- ✅ Add new commission entry form
- ✅ Edit/Delete existing entries
- ✅ Add new salesperson on-the-fly
- ✅ Automatic calculations (real-time)
- ✅ Comprehensive filtering (salesperson, date, status, invoice)
- ✅ 2 interactive charts (Bar + Doughnut)
- ✅ Export to Excel (CSV)
- ✅ Responsive design

**Lines of Code**: ~1,200 lines (complete system)

### Calculation Method (Reverse VAT):

**Formula**:
```
1. Net Supplier Cost = Product Cost ÷ (1 + Profit% / 100)
2. Company Profit = Product Cost - Net Supplier Cost
3. Salesperson Commission = Net Supplier Cost × (Commission% / 100)
4. Company Net Profit = Company Profit - Salesperson Commission
```

**Example**:
- Product Cost: €10,000
- Company Profit: 10%
- Salesperson Commission: 2.5%

**Results**:
- Net Supplier Cost: €9,090.91
- Company Profit: €909.09
- Salesperson Commission: €227.27
- Company Net Profit: €681.82

### Why This Method?

This is the **αποφορολόγηση** (reverse VAT) method you requested:
- Calculates the base cost before applying the profit margin
- Ensures accurate commission calculation on actual supplier cost
- Commonly used in Greek business practices
- Matches your specification exactly
