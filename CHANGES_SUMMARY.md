# I Trusty CRM - Changes Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Changes (As Requested)

### 1. **Fixed Theme Switching** üé®
**Problem**: Theme colors weren't changing when clicking theme options  
**Root Cause**: Conflicting Tailwind CSS classes on `<body>` and `<header>` elements were overriding CSS custom properties  
**Solution**: Removed hardcoded `class="bg-gray-50 text-gray-900"` from body and `class="bg-white"` from header

**Now working**: All 5 themes switch smoothly
- Default (multicolor)
- Elegant (navy/cream)
- Eco (green/beige)
- Santorini (Greek blue/white)
- Colorful Gold (coral/gold)

**Location preserved**: Theme dropdown remains in top-right corner, hover-activated, discrete design ‚úì

### 2. **Collapsible Navigation Tabs** üéØ
**Requirement**: Transform tabs (Projects, Orders, etc.) into small icon-only squares that expand on hover

**Implementation**:
- **Default state**: 48x48px squares showing only colorful icons
- **Hover state**: Expands smoothly to 180px with text label appearing
- **Animation**: 0.3s ease transition with subtle lift effect
- **Colors preserved**: Each tab retains its original color (purple, orange, indigo, red, cyan, teal)

**CSS Magic**: Pure CSS hover expansion, no JavaScript needed
```css
.nav-tab { width: 48px; }
.nav-tab:hover { width: 180px; }
.nav-tab-text { opacity: 0; }
.nav-tab:hover .nav-tab-text { opacity: 1; }
