## 📱 Feature 3: WeChat Notifications

### How It Works

**Automatic Notifications are Sent When**:

1. **@Mentioned in Comments**:
   - Someone writes: "@Ruby please check this"
   - Ruby instantly receives WeChat notification

2. **Assigned to Workflow Step**:
   - Order created with 17 steps
   - Assigned person gets notification

3. **Step Due Soon** (48 hours):
   - Reminder sent to assignee
   - "QC Inspection due in 2 days"

4. **Step Overdue**:
   - Urgent notification sent
   - "Sourcing is overdue by 1 day"

### Notification Format

**WeChat Message**:
```
💬 Ruby mentioned you

In GST-251013 - Sourcing:
"Found 3 suppliers. @Lily can you review specs?"

[View Order]
```

**Notification Types**:
- 💬 Comment - Someone mentioned you
- 📌 Assignment - New task assigned
- ⏰ Reminder - Due soon (48h warning)
- 🚨 Urgent - Overdue task
- ✅ Complete - Step finished (if watching)
- 💰 Payment - Deposit/payment received

### WeChat Setup (Team Members)

For notifications to work, each team member must have their **WeChat ID** stored:

**Current WeChat IDs** (from your team data):
- Ruby: `ruby_itrusty`
- Lily: `lily_itrusty`
- Peng: `peng_yiwu`
- Others: Need to be added in team management

### Checking Notification Status

All sent notifications stored in `wechat_notifications` table:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| recipient_staff_id | Who receives it |
| wechat_id | Their WeChat ID |
| notification_type | comment, assignment, deadline |
| title | Short headline |
| message | Full notification text |
| delivery_status | pending, sent, failed, read |
| sent_at | Timestamp |

**Step 3**: Ruby updates:
- Status: "Not Started" → "Completed"
- Actual Hours: 6 hours
- Adds comment: "Found supplier in Guangzhou. Quote is ¥85,000. @Lily please approve."

**Step 4**: System automatically:
- ✅ Marks step as completed
- ✅ Logs 6 hours (cost: ¥600 at Ruby's ¥100/hr rate)
- ✅ Posts comment to thread
- ✅ Sends WeChat notification to Lily
- ✅ Logs activity: "Ruby: Finished Sourcing"

**Step 5**: Lily receives WeChat notification

**Step 6**: Lily clicks notification → Opens orders page

**Step 7**: Lily clicks "Sourcing" step

**Step 8**: Lily sees Ruby's comment

**Step 9**: Lily replies: "@Ruby Great work! Approved. Please proceed with PO."

**Step 10**: Ruby receives WeChat notification of Lily's reply

**Result**: Complete transparency, instant communication, automatic tracking!

**After**:

- ✅ Compact layout, more space for orders

---

## 📱 WeChat Integration (Technical)

### Current Status: **Simulated**

Right now, the system **logs** WeChat notifications but doesn't actually send them. Here's what happens:

1. Comment with @mention posted
2. System creates record in `wechat_notifications` table
3. Console logs: "WeChat notification sent to [name]"
4. **But notification not actually sent to WeChat**

### To Make It Real

You need to:

1. **Register** for WeChat Work API (企业微信)
2. **Get** API credentials (corp_id, secret)
3. **Implement** send function in backend
4. **Call** WeChat API when notification created

**Code needed** (backend/server-side):

```javascript
async function sendWeChatMessage(wechatId, message) {
    // Get access token
    const token = await getWeChatAccessToken();
    
    // Send message via WeChat Work API
    const response = await fetch('https://qyapi.weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/message/send', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            touser: wechatId,
            msgtype: 'text',
            agentid: YOUR_AGENT_ID,
            text: { content: message }
        })
    });
    
    return response.json();
}
```

**For now**, team members can:
- Check the system regularly for new comments
- Or you can manually notify them until API integrated

---

## ✅ Summary

**You now have**:
- ✅ Fully editable orders
- ✅ Step-by-step comment threads
- ✅ @mention notifications (simulated)
- ✅ Complete audit trail
- ✅ Cleaner UI with compact layout

**Team can now**:
- Edit order details anytime
- Discuss each step in context
- Tag colleagues for attention
- See complete comment history
- Track who said what, when

**This replaces**:
- Lost WeChat messages
- Scattered communications
- Unclear accountability
- Missing context

**Your operations are now more transparent, organized, and trackable!** 🎉
