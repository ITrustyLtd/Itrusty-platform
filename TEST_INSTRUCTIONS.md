# Testing Instructions for New Features

## 🧪 How to Test the Changes

### ✅ **1. Test Theme Switching** (FIXED!)

**Expected Behavior**: Background colors should change smoothly when selecting themes

**Steps**:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Look at top-right corner, find small "🎨 Theme" label
3. Hover over the label → Dropdown menu appears
4. Click "Elegant" → Background should turn cream/beige (#F4F3EE)
5. Click "Eco" → Background should turn light green/beige (#EFEDE0)
6. Click "Santorini" → Background should turn light blue-gray (#F1F1F3)
7. Click "Colorful" → Background should turn golden beige (#FBE2B1)
8. Click "Default" → Background returns to white (#FFFFFF)
9. Refresh page → Theme should persist (stored in localStorage)

**What Was Fixed**: 
- Removed conflicting Tailwind classes `bg-gray-50` and `bg-white` from body/header
- Now CSS custom properties work properly: `var(--body-bg)` and `var(--header-bg)`
