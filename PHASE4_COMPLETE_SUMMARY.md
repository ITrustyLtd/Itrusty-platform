## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Inline Editing Pattern**
```javascript
onclick="editCell(this, transactionId, fieldName, inputType)"
↓
User clicks cell
↓
Cell converts to input field
↓
User edits value
↓
onblur → saveCell() → PATCH /tables/transactions_customers/{id}
↓
Database updates
↓
Reload data → Refresh table → Update dashboard
```

### **Auto-Calculation Pattern** (Customer Transactions)
```javascript
outstanding = ci_amount - total_paid
↓
Rendered in table cell with color class
↓
Any edit to ci_amount or total_paid → Recalculates automatically
```

### **Real-time Filtering**
```javascript
filterTransactions()
↓
Rebuild filteredTransactions array based on selected filters
↓
renderTable() → Update spreadsheet view
↓
updateDashboard() → Recalculate totals and charts
```
