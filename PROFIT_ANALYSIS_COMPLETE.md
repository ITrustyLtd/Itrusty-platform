## 🔗 How Profit Calculation Works

### **Matching Logic**:
```javascript
// 1. Load customer transactions (revenue)
customerTransactions = GET /tables/transactions_customers

// 2. Load supplier transactions (costs)
supplierTransactions = GET /tables/transactions_suppliers

// 3. Match by invoice_number or order_number
for each customerTransaction:
  matchingSupplierPayments = supplierTransactions.filter(
    s => s.invoice_number === customerTransaction.invoice_number ||
         s.order_number === customerTransaction.invoice_number
  )
  
  totalCostsRMB = sum(matchingSupplierPayments.amount)
  totalCostsEUR = totalCostsRMB / FX_EUR_RMB
  
  revenueEUR = convert(customerTransaction.ci_amount, customerTransaction.currency)
  
  profit = revenueEUR - totalCostsEUR
  margin = (profit / revenueEUR) * 100
```

### **Currency Conversion**:
```javascript
FX Rates (from localStorage or defaults):
- EUR_RMB: 8.27
- USD_RMB: 7.24
- EUR_USD: 1.14

// Convert customer revenue to EUR
if currency === 'EUR': revenue = amount
if currency === 'USD': revenue = amount / EUR_USD
if currency === 'RMB': revenue = amount / EUR_RMB

// Convert supplier costs to EUR
costsEUR = costsRMB / EUR_RMB
```

### **Office Assignment**:
```javascript
// Try to find order record
order = orders.find(o => o.order_number === invoice_number)
office = order?.office || 'Unknown'

// Aggregate by office
officeProfit[office] = {
  revenue: sum(revenue),
  costs: sum(costs),
  profit: revenue - costs
}
```
