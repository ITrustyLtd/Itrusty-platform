## ✅ ALL YOUR REQUESTED FIXES ARE COMPLETE!

### What I Fixed (As You Requested):

1. ✅ **Double € symbol** - Now shows `€1,955,360.00` instead of `€€1955360.00`
2. ✅ **Missing commas** - All numbers now show as `1,955,360.00` instead of `1955360.00`
3. ✅ **Bank accounts** - Now ONLY show in Pro Forma Invoice (hidden in Quotation/Commercial)
4. ✅ **Print layout** - Compressed all sections by 20-30% for better A4 printing

### **Step 2: Test Number Formatting**
Add a product with these values:
- **CTN**: `100`
- **QTY PER CTN**: `5000`
- **UNIT PRICE €**: `39.12`

**Expected Result**:
```
TOTAL QTY: 500,000.00       ← Should show COMMAS
TOTAL PRICE €: 19,560,000.00 ← Should show COMMAS
Grand Total: €19,560,000.00  ← Should show SINGLE € + COMMAS
```

### **Step 3: Test Bank Account Visibility**

**Test A: Quotation (Banks should be HIDDEN)**
1. Select Invoice Type: **Quotation**
2. Look at footer section
3. ✅ **PASS** if you see ONLY "Financial Summary" on the right (no bank accounts)

**Test B: Pro Forma (Banks should be VISIBLE)**
1. Select Invoice Type: **Pro Forma Invoice**
2. Look at footer section
3. ✅ **PASS** if you see "Bank Accounts" on the left AND "Financial Summary" on the right

**Test C: Commercial (Banks should be HIDDEN)**
1. Select Invoice Type: **Commercial Invoice**
2. Look at footer section
3. ✅ **PASS** if you see ONLY "Financial Summary" centered (no bank accounts)

### **Step 4: Test Print Layout**
1. Click browser Print button (or press `Ctrl+P` / `Cmd+P`)
2. Check preview:
   - ✅ Logo should be smaller (~50px height)
   - ✅ Badge should be compact
   - ✅ Customer/Shipper boxes should be tight
   - ✅ Column headers should be thin
   - ✅ Overall invoice should fit nicely on A4
