## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Products not showing in Library**
**Check**:
1. Did invoice save successfully?
2. Check browser console (F12) for errors
3. Refresh products-library.html page
4. Look for console message: "💾 Saving products to library..."

### **Issue: Too many duplicates**
**Reason**: Duplicate detection uses name + price
**Solution**: Products with different prices will be added (this is correct!)

### **Issue: Print columns still showing**
**Check**:
1. Use actual Print Preview (Ctrl+P)
2. Not just browser view
3. Internal columns should disappear in print mode

### **Issue: CSV upload fails**
**Check**:
1. CSV has correct headers (Name, Unit Price EUR required)
2. File is actually CSV format (not Excel .xlsx)
3. No special characters or formatting issues

## 💡 Pro Testing Tips

### **Tip 1: Use Different Templates**
Test with all 4 templates to ensure compatibility:
- 📥_SAMPLE_TEMPLATE_ELECTRONICS.csv

- Upload same template multiple times
- Mix manual entry + CSV upload

### **Tip 3: Monitor Console**
Keep browser console open (F12) to see:
- What's being saved
- What's being skipped
- Any errors that occur

### **Tip 4: Clear Cache**
If something seems broken:
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
