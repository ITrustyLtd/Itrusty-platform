### 1. **Main Dashboard Full Interactivity** (`index.html`)

**Technical Implementation:**

  - `projectDetailModal` - Full project editing
  - `addTaskModal` - Create new task

### 7. **Workflow Steps Display Fixed** (`orders-enhanced.html`)

**Technical Fix:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (WRONG)
const orderSteps = this.workflowSteps
    .filter(s => s.order_id === order.id)
    .slice(0, 8);  // ❌ Only first 8

// AFTER (CORRECT)
const orderSteps = this.workflowSteps
    .filter(s => s.order_id === order.id)
    .sort((a, b) => (a.step_order || 0) - (b.step_order || 0));  // ✅ Sorted
```

  - Applied `max-height: 50vh` to:

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### JavaScript Module Loading Order (CRITICAL)
```html
<!-- MUST LOAD IN THIS ORDER -->
<script src="js/projects.js"></script>         <!-- 1st: Exports window.projectsManager -->
<script src="js/dashboard-main.js"></script>   <!-- 2nd: Depends on projectsManager -->
<script src="js/app.js"></script>              <!-- 3rd: Main calendar logic -->
```

**Why This Order Matters:**
1. `js/projects.js` creates `window.projectsManager` global instance
2. `js/dashboard-main.js` uses `window.projectsManager.showProjectDetail()`
3. `js/app.js` also uses `window.projectsManager.showProjectDetail()`
4. If projects.js loads last, `window.projectsManager` is undefined → ERRORS

### Data Flow Pattern
```
User Action (Click event)
    ↓
Event Handler (js/app.js or js/dashboard-main.js)
    ↓
Delegate to Manager Class (window.projectsManager)
    ↓
Manager Method (showProjectDetail, saveProjectFromDetail, etc.)
    ↓
API Call (PATCH/POST/DELETE /tables/...)
    ↓
Database Update
    ↓
Reload Data (fetch latest from database)
    ↓
Update UI (calendar, lists, modals)
    ↓
User Sees Changes (immediate feedback)
```

### Modal System
```
Main Dashboard (index.html)
├── createProjectModal (from original - for "New Project" button)
├── createTaskModal (from original - for "New Task" button)
├── projectDetailModal (NEW - for editing projects)
├── addTaskModal (NEW - for adding tasks to project)
├── editTaskModal (NEW - for editing individual tasks)
├── dailyActivitiesModal (from original - for date clicks)
├── addActivityModal (from original - for adding activities)
└── editActivityModal (from original - for editing activities)

All modals use z-index stacking:
- Base modals: z-50
- Nested modals: z-[60]
- Ensures proper layering when multiple modals open
```
