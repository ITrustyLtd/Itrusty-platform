## 💡 PRO TIPS

### **Tip 1: Always Check Console**
Press F12 → Console tab to see real-time updates:
```
💰 Recording payment
✅ Payment saved
✅ Balance updated: CCB-EUR | €5000 → €5200 | +€200
```

### **Tip 2: Use Correct Currency**
Match transaction currency with account currency:
- CCB-EUR account → EUR transactions ✅
- CCB-EUR account → USD transactions ❌ (mismatch!)

### **Tip 3: Supplier Status Matters**
For suppliers, only "Paid" status updates balance:
- Status = Pending → No balance change
- Status = Paid → Balance decreases

### **Tip 4: Inline Editing One Field at a Time**
You can't edit amount AND account together:
- Click cell → Edit → Save
- Then click next cell → Edit → Save

### **Tip 5: Use Ledger for Verification**
If balances seem wrong:
1. Click "Ledger" button
2. Check chronological list
3. Verify Before/After/Change amounts

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Issue: Payment Not Recorded**

**Check:**
1. Console (F12) - Any error messages?
2. Network tab - Any failed requests?
3. Form validation - All required fields filled?
4. Account selection - Correct account chosen?

**Solution:**
- Fill all required fields (marked with *)
- Select an active account
- Refresh page (Ctrl+F5) and try again

---

### **Issue: Balance Not Updating**

**Check:**
1. Console - Did you see "✅ Balance updated"?
2. finance.html - Refresh page (Ctrl+F5)
3. Currency match - Transaction and account same currency?
4. Status (suppliers) - Is status set to "Paid"?

**Solution:**
- For suppliers: Change status to "Paid"
- Check currency matches
- Verify console messages

---

### **Issue: Payment Not in History**

**Check:**
1. Which page did you use?
2. Did you see success message?
3. Try refreshing the page

**Where to look:**
- finance.html → "Payments" button → Should show ALL payments
- finance.html → "History" on card → Shows account-specific
- finance.html → "Ledger" on card → Shows finance.html payments only

---

### **Issue: Ledger Empty**

**Explanation:**
Ledger only shows payments recorded from finance.html "Record Payment" button.

**Other payments:**
- transactions-customers: Shows in unified history but not in ledger
- transactions-suppliers: Shows in unified history but not in ledger

**Why:**
Only finance.html payments have full balance tracking (before/after).
