## üìã What Was Implemented

- `vat_number` (text)

**Test It**:
1. Go to Invoice Creator
2. Select "GLS - Global SAT S.A." from customer dropdown
3. **Expected Result**: Address shows "P.O.BOX:74001-40, T.K. FLORINA, ATHENS, Postal Code: 15351, GREECE"

### ‚úÖ 2. Product Grid Column Restructure (COMPLETE)

**Changes Made**:

#### ‚úÖ **Item Number** - Now Editable
- **Before**: Auto-numbered only (1, 2, 3...)
- **After**: Fully editable cell - you can change to any number/text

#### ‚úÖ **Picture Column** - Now Shows Image
- **Before**: URL input field (ugly)
- **After**: Displays actual product image thumbnail (16√ó16px)
- Shows "No image" placeholder when empty
- Auto-updates when you enter Image URL

#### ‚úÖ **Image URL Field** - Repositioned
- **Before**: In 2nd column (confused with Picture)
- **After**: Moved to right side, next to Product URL, before Notes
- Marked as "no-print" (hidden when printing)

#### ‚úÖ **MIN URL Column** - Removed
- **Before**: Had a "MIN URL" column (unclear purpose)
- **After**: Completely removed from grid

#### ‚úÖ **Markup %** - Consolidated
- **Before**: Appeared in 2 columns (duplicate)
- **After**: Single column on right side (no-print)

**New Column Order**:
```
1. Item Number (editable) ‚úèÔ∏è
2. Picture (image display) üñºÔ∏è
3. Name
4. Description
5. CTN
6. QTY per CTN
7. Total QTY (editable) ‚úèÔ∏è
8. Unit Price ‚Ç¨ (editable) ‚úèÔ∏è
9. Total Price ‚Ç¨ (editable) ‚úèÔ∏è
10. Product URL
11. Image URL (no-print) üîí
12. Notes
13. Price CNY (no-print) üîí
14. FX Rate (no-print) üîí
15. Markup % (no-print) üîí
16. Actions (no-print) üîí
```

**Test It**:
1. Click "Add Product Row"
2. **Try editing** the Item Number (e.g., change "1" to "A1")
3. Enter an image URL in the "Image URL" field (column 11)
4. **Expected**: Image appears immediately in Picture column
5. Enter values in Price CNY, FX Rate, Markup %
6. **Expected**: Unit Price auto-calculates

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Smart Calculations with Manual Override (COMPLETE)

#### ‚úÖ **New Unit Price Formula**
```
Unit Price EUR = (Price CNY √ó (1 + Markup%/100)) / FX Rate
```

**Example**:
- Price CNY: 100
- Markup %: 25
- FX Rate: 8
- **Result**: (100 √ó 1.25) / 8 = ‚Ç¨15.625

**BUT**: You can still manually edit the Unit Price if you want to give a discount!

#### ‚úÖ **Total Quantity** - Auto-calc BUT Editable
- **Auto-calculates**: `Total QTY = CTN √ó QTY per CTN`
- **BUT**: You can manually edit if needed
- System detects manual edits and preserves them

#### ‚úÖ **Total Price** - Auto-calc BUT Editable
- **Auto-calculates**: `Total Price = Total QTY √ó Unit Price`
- **BUT**: You can manually edit for special pricing
- System detects manual edits and preserves them

**Smart Behavior**:
- When you type in CTN or QTY per CTN ‚Üí Total QTY auto-updates
- When you type in Price CNY, Markup %, or FX Rate ‚Üí Unit Price auto-calculates
- When you type in Total QTY or Unit Price ‚Üí Total Price auto-updates
- **BUT**: If you manually edit a calculated field, it becomes "locked" and won't auto-update

**Test It**:
1. Add a product row
2. Enter: Price CNY = 100, Markup % = 25, FX Rate = 8
3. **Expected**: Unit Price = 15.63 (auto-calculated)
4. Now manually change Unit Price to 12.00 (discount!)
5. Change Markup % to 30
6. **Expected**: Unit Price stays at 12.00 (your manual edit is preserved)
7. Enter: CTN = 5, QTY per CTN = 100
8. **Expected**: Total QTY = 500 (auto-calculated)
9. Now manually change Total QTY to 450
10. Change CTN to 6
11. **Expected**: Total QTY stays at 450 (your manual edit is preserved)
