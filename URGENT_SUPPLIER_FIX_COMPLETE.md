## 🚨 **CRITICAL FOR YOUR OPERATIONS**

### **Multi-Office Impact**:
- **Yiwu Office**: Uses CCB RMB, Merchants Bank RMB, Alipay, Wechat

- **Greece Office**: Uses EUR accounts (REVOLUTE, N26, etc.)

**Before**: Payments from each office recorded to WRONG accounts ❌  
**After**: Each office's payments properly tracked to CORRECT accounts ✅

### **Multi-Currency Impact**:
- **EUR accounts**: REVOLUTE, TRANSFER WISE €, Mario €, CCB €, N26, RAPYD €, Φοινικιανάκης
- **USD accounts**: PAYPAL $, CCB $, NEAT $
- **RMB accounts**: CCB RMB, Mario CNY, Alipay, Wechat, Merchants Bank RMB
- **HKD accounts**: NEAT HKD

**Before**: Currency-specific payments recorded to wrong account types ❌  
**After**: Each payment properly tracked to correct currency account ✅

## 🐛 **IF SUPPLIER DROPDOWN STILL SHOWS WRONG ACCOUNTS**

### **Possible Causes**:

1. **Browser Cache Not Cleared**
   - **Solution**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Or: Clear cache completely and reload

2. **localStorage Has Old Data**
   - **Solution**: In Console (F12), run:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem('bank_accounts');
   location.reload();
   ```

3. **Still Loading Old JavaScript File**
   - **Solution**: 
   ```javascript
   // In Console (F12):
   localStorage.clear();
   // Then do hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
   ```

---

## 📞 **NEXT STEPS**

### **1. TEST NOW** (5 minutes):
1. Clear browser cache completely
2. Test Customer Transactions (should already work ✅)
3. Test Supplier Payments (should now work ✅)
4. Check Console logs

### **2. REPORT BACK**:
- ✅ **If both work**: Phase 4 COMPLETE → Ready for Phase 5
- ❌ **If supplier still broken**: Send me:
  - Screenshot of supplier dropdown
  - Screenshot of Console (F12 → Console tab)
  - Screenshot of Network tab (F12 → Network → filter "financial_accounts")

### **3. VERIFY DATA INTEGRITY**:
Once working, verify:
