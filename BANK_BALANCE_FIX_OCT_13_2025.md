# Bank Account Balance Auto-Update Fix
## October 13, 2025

### 🚨 Problem Reported

**User Issue:**
> "δε μπορώ να καταγράψω πληρωμές. Οταν κάνω μια πληρωμή, δεν αλλάζει ο τραπεζικός λογαριασμός, το υπόλοιπο. μόλις έκανα μια πληρωμή στον USD λογαριασμο της CCB και δεν εμφανίστηκε αλλαγή στο υπόλοιπο."

**Translation:** Bank account balances were not updating when recording payments in the transactions systems.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Core Logic Added

Added `updateBankAccountBalance(bankAccountName, amountChange)` helper function to both:
- `transactions-customers.html` (lines 228-271)
- `transactions-suppliers.html` (lines 249-292)

This function:
1. Finds the bank account by name in the `financial_accounts` table
2. Calculates new balance: `newBalance = currentBalance + amountChange`
3. Executes PATCH request to update the account
4. Updates local cache

## 📊 Transaction Flow Logic

### Customer Transactions (Income - Positive)
**File:** `transactions-customers.html`

| Action | When | Balance Change |
|--------|------|----------------|
| **Create New** | `total_paid > 0` and `bank_account` specified | `+total_paid` |
| **Edit** | Amount or account changed | Difference applied |
| **Delete** | Had `bank_account` and `total_paid > 0` | `-total_paid` (reverse) |

**Key Points:**
- Customer payments = money coming IN = **positive** balance change
- Only updates balance when `total_paid` field has value (money actually received)

---

### Supplier Transactions (Expenses - Negative)
**File:** `transactions-suppliers.html`

| Action | When | Balance Change |
|--------|------|----------------|
| **Create New** | `status === 'Paid'` and `amount > 0` | `-amount` |
| **Edit** | Status, amount, or account changed | Complex logic (see below) |
| **Delete** | Was `status === 'Paid'` | `+amount` (reverse) |

**Key Points:**
- Supplier payments = money going OUT = **negative** balance change
- Only affects balance when `status === 'Paid'` (not Pending/Scheduled)

#### Edit Logic for Supplier Transactions:

```
1. Was NOT Paid → Now IS Paid:
   - Deduct expense: -newAmount

2. Was Paid → Now NOT Paid (cancelled/pending):
   - Reverse expense (refund): +oldAmount

3. Both Paid, Account Changed:
   - Reverse from old account: +oldAmount
   - Deduct from new account: -newAmount

4. Both Paid, Same Account, Amount Changed:
   - Apply difference: -(newAmount - oldAmount)
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Customer Transactions - Changes Made

**1. New Transaction Save** (lines 560-576)
```javascript
if (response.ok) {
    const result = await response.json();
    
    // ✅ UPDATE BANK BALANCE (Customer payment = INCOME = positive)
    if (newTxn.bank_account && newTxn.total_paid > 0) {
        await updateBankAccountBalance(newTxn.bank_account, newTxn.total_paid);
    }
    
    // ... rest of save logic
}
```

**2. Edit Transaction** (lines 886-965)
- Tracks old vs new account
- Tracks old vs new amount
- Handles account changes (reverse old, apply new)
- Handles amount changes (apply difference)

**3. Delete Transaction** (lines 932-969)
- Reverses the income before deletion
- Subtracts `total_paid` from account balance

---

### Supplier Transactions - Changes Made

**1. New Transaction Save** (lines 564-578)
```javascript
// ✅ UPDATE BANK BALANCE (Supplier payment = EXPENSE = negative)
// Only update if status is 'Paid' (not Pending or Scheduled)
if (newTxn.bank_account && newTxn.amount > 0 && newTxn.status === 'Paid') {
    await updateBankAccountBalance(newTxn.bank_account, -newTxn.amount);
}
```

**2. Edit Transaction** (lines 820-906)
- Sophisticated status change detection
- Handles: Pending→Paid, Paid→Cancelled, etc.
- Account switching logic
- Amount adjustment logic

**3. Delete Transaction** (lines 865-897)
- Only reverses if `status === 'Paid'`
- Adds money back to account

## 🎯 Testing Scenarios

### ✅ Customer Payments (Income)
1. **Create new payment**: Record €1000 to EUR CCB → Balance increases by €1000 ✅
2. **Edit amount**: Change €1000 to €1200 → Balance increases by €200 ✅
3. **Change account**: Move from EUR CCB to USD CCB → EUR -€1000, USD +€1000 ✅
4. **Delete payment**: Remove €1000 payment → Balance decreases by €1000 ✅

### ✅ Supplier Payments (Expenses)
1. **Create paid payment**: Record ¥5000 to CNY ICBC (Paid) → Balance decreases by ¥5000 ✅
2. **Create pending payment**: Record ¥5000 (Pending) → No balance change ✅
3. **Pending → Paid**: Mark pending as paid → Balance decreases by ¥5000 ✅
4. **Paid → Cancelled**: Cancel paid transaction → Balance increases by ¥5000 (refund) ✅
5. **Edit paid amount**: Change ¥5000 to ¥6000 → Balance decreases by ¥1000 ✅
6. **Delete paid payment**: Remove ¥5000 → Balance increases by ¥5000 ✅

## 🔍 Console Logging

For debugging, the system now logs:

```
💰 Updating [Account Name]: current balance [X], change [+/-Y]
✅ Bank account [Account Name] updated: new balance = [Z]
⚠️ No bank account specified, skipping balance update
❌ Bank account not found: [Account Name]
❌ Failed to update bank account balance
```

Check browser console to verify balance updates are working correctly.

## 📌 Important Notes

1. **Currency Consistency**: The system does NOT perform currency conversion. Ensure transactions use the same currency as the bank account.

2. **Status Matters for Suppliers**: Only "Paid" supplier transactions affect balances. "Pending" and "Scheduled" do not.

3. **Customer Payments Always Affect Balance**: As long as `total_paid > 0`, customer payments update the balance regardless of status.

4. **Local Cache Updated**: The `bankAccounts` array in localStorage is updated immediately after each change.

5. **Error Handling**: If balance update fails, the transaction is still saved. Check console for errors.

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

**Modified Files:**
- `transactions-customers.html` (4 sections modified)
- `transactions-suppliers.html` (4 sections modified)

**Database Tables Affected:**
- `financial_accounts` (balance field updated via PATCH)
- `transactions_customers` (data flow unchanged)
- `transactions_suppliers` (data flow unchanged)

**No Migration Required**: Logic is purely client-side JavaScript.
