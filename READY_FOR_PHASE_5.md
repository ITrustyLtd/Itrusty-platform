## 🎯 How It Works (Technical)

### **Profit Calculation Logic**:
```
1. Load customer transactions (revenue):
   - Invoice amounts in EUR, USD, or RMB
   - Convert all to EUR using FX rates

2. Load supplier transactions (costs):
   - Payment amounts in RMB
   - Convert to EUR using FX rate (EUR_RMB = 8.27)

3. Match by invoice_number:
   - For each customer invoice
   - Find all supplier payments with matching invoice_number or order_number
   - Sum supplier costs

4. Calculate profit:
   Profit = Revenue (EUR) - Costs (EUR)
   Margin % = (Profit / Revenue) × 100

5. Group by customer:
   Sum revenue, costs, profit per customer

6. Group by office:
   Find order record to get office
   Sum revenue, costs, profit per office
```

### **Currency Conversion**:
```javascript
FX Rates (from localStorage):
- EUR to RMB: 8.27
- USD to RMB: 7.24
- EUR to USD: 1.14

// Customer revenue → EUR
if (currency === 'EUR'): revenue = amount
if (currency === 'USD'): revenue = amount / 1.14
if (currency === 'RMB'): revenue = amount / 8.27

// Supplier costs → EUR
costsEUR = costsRMB / 8.27
```
