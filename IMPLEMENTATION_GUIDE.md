## 🎨 Theme System Technical Details

### How Themes Work

1. **CSS Custom Properties**
   - Root level variables defined in `:root` selector
   - Each theme overrides in `[data-theme="name"]` selector
   - Example:
   ```css
   :root {
       --primary-color: #1F2A44;  /* Elegant theme default */
   }
   [data-theme="eco"] {
       --primary-color: #486349;  /* Eco theme override */
   }
   ```

2. **JavaScript Theme Switching**
   - `changeTheme(themeName)` function in dashboard-enhanced.js
   - Sets `data-theme` attribute on `<html>` element
   - Saves to localStorage for persistence
   - Refreshes charts to match new colors

3. **Automatic Chart Color Updates**
   - Charts use CSS variables via `getComputedStyle()`
   - `getPrimaryColor()` function reads current theme
   - Charts are destroyed and redrawn on theme change

### Adding Your Own Theme

1. **Edit `index-new.html`**
   - Add new CSS block in `<style>` section:
   ```css
   [data-theme="mytheme"] {
       --primary-color: #YOUR_COLOR;
       --primary-light: #YOUR_LIGHT_COLOR;
       --primary-lighter: #YOUR_LIGHTER_COLOR;
       --accent-color: #YOUR_ACCENT;
       --accent-light: #YOUR_ACCENT_LIGHT;
       --background: #YOUR_BACKGROUND;
       --text-dark: #333333;
       --text-light: #6B7280;
   }
   ```

2. **Add Theme Button**
   ```html
   <button class="theme-button" 
           data-theme="mytheme" 
           onclick="changeTheme('mytheme')" 
           style="background: #YOUR_COLOR" 
           title="My Theme"></button>
   ```

3. **Test**
   - Reload page
   - Click your new theme button
   - Entire interface should change to your colors

---

## 📊 Dashboard Data Flow

### Automatic Data Loading

**On Page Load:**
1. Load saved theme from localStorage
2. Load saved language from localStorage
3. Fetch data from 5 tables in parallel:
   - `tables/orders` (all orders)
   - `tables/team_members` (all staff)
   - `tables/workflow_steps` (all tasks)
   - `tables/suppliers` (all suppliers)
   - `tables/projects` (all projects)

**Processing:**
1. Calculate Quick Stats (active orders, revenue, payroll, overdue)
2. Generate Alerts (check due dates, stuck orders, payment reminders)
3. Render 4 Charts (pipeline, utilization, performance)

**Auto-Refresh:**
- Every 2 minutes (120 seconds)
- Re-fetches all data
- Updates stats, alerts, and charts
- Keeps dashboard current without manual refresh

### Data Calculation Details

**Active Orders**
- Filter orders where status ≠ 'Completed' AND ≠ 'Cancelled' AND ≠ 'Closed'

**Monthly Revenue**
- Filter orders by current month AND current year
- Only count if status = 'Confirmed' OR 'Production' OR 'Shipping' OR 'Completed'
- Sum of `total_value_usd` field

**Monthly Payroll**
- Sum of all `base_salary_rmb` from team_members table
- Current total: ¥87,815

**Overdue Items**
- Filter workflow_steps where:
  - `due_date` < current date
  - `status` ≠ 'Completed'
- Count total

## 🔄 Integration with Existing System

### Connecting Orders to Suppliers

Your existing `orders-enhanced.html` needs minor update to link suppliers:

**Option 1: Add Supplier Dropdown to Order Form**

In `orders-enhanced.html`, add to the order creation form:

```html
<div class="form-group">
    <label for="supplierId">Supplier (for RMB orders)</label>
    <select id="supplierId" class="form-control">
        <option value="">-- Select Supplier --</option>
        <!-- Populated dynamically from suppliers table -->
    </select>
</div>
```

Load suppliers in JavaScript:
```javascript
async function loadSupplierDropdown() {
    const response = await fetch('tables/suppliers?limit=1000');
    const data = await response.json();
    const select = document.getElementById('supplierId');
    
    data.data.forEach(supplier => {
        const option = document.createElement('option');
        option.value = supplier.id;
        option.textContent = supplier.supplier_name;
        select.appendChild(option);
    });
}
```

Save with order:
```javascript
const orderData = {
    // ... existing fields
    supplier_id: document.getElementById('supplierId').value,
    currency: 'RMB'  // Indicate this is RMB order
};
```

**Option 2: Add Supplier Update Workflow**

When workflow step "Supplier Payment" is marked complete:
1. Record supplier_id in order
2. Update supplier's `total_orders_count` += 1
3. Update supplier's `total_spent_rmb` += order RMB amount

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Not Loading Data

**Symptom:** Stats show 0, charts are empty

**Solution:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for error messages
3. Verify database tables exist:
   - `tables/orders`
   - `tables/team_members`
   - `tables/workflow_steps`
   - `tables/suppliers`
   - `tables/projects`
4. If tables don't exist, they'll return empty arrays (this is OK initially)

### Theme Not Switching

**Symptom:** Clicking theme buttons does nothing

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `js/dashboard-enhanced.js` is loaded
3. Check if `changeTheme` function exists: type `changeTheme` in console
4. Clear localStorage and reload: `localStorage.clear()`

### Language Toggle Not Working

**Symptom:** EN/中文 buttons don't change interface

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console
2. Verify all translatable elements have correct IDs
3. Test `switchLanguage` function in console: `switchLanguage('zh')`
4. Check translations object in dashboard-enhanced.js

### Supplier Cards Not Displaying

**Symptom:** Supplier page shows "No suppliers found" even though you added some

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for fetch errors
2. Verify supplier was actually saved to database:
   ```javascript
   fetch('tables/suppliers').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
   ```
3. Check filter settings (make sure "All" is selected)
4. Clear search box

### Charts Not Rendering

**Symptom:** Dashboard shows empty spaces where charts should be

**Solution:**
1. Verify Chart.js CDN is loading (check Network tab in F12)
2. Check console for Chart.js errors
3. Verify canvas elements exist:
   ```javascript
   document.getElementById('pipelineChart')
   document.getElementById('utilizationChart')
   document.getElementById('performanceChart')
   ```
4. Try different theme (sometimes color calculation fails)

### WeChat Notifications Not Sending

**Symptom:** Clicking WeChat icon does nothing or shows error

**Solution:**
This is expected in development mode. The system logs to console instead of actually sending. To enable real sending:
1. Set up WeChat Work API (see "Setting Up WeChat Integration" section)
2. Implement backend endpoint
3. Uncomment production code in dashboard-enhanced.js
4. Test with real WeChat IDs
