# ✅ FIXED! Ready to Test

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **Error Found:**
```
❌ TypeError: this.closeComposeModal is not a function
```

### **Root Cause:**
The `closeComposeModal` function was defined as a global function but was being called as a class method (`this.closeComposeModal()`).

### **Solution Applied:**
✅ Changed `this.closeComposeModal()` to `closeComposeModal()`
✅ Added proper cleanup when modal closes
✅ Reset selected recipients after sending
✅ Uncheck all checkboxes automatically

---

## 🚀 **Test It Now!**

### **Quick Test (30 seconds):**

1. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+R or F5)
2. Click **"New Message"**
3. **Check yourself** (Johny CEO) ✅
4. Subject: **"Test"**
5. Message: **"Testing the fix"**
6. Click **"Send Message"**
7. Should see: **✅ "Message sent successfully! ✅"**
8. Modal should **close automatically**
9. Message should appear in **inbox**

## 🐛 **If You Still See Errors**

### **Hard Refresh:**
1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac)

✅ Sending to 1 recipients: [...]
📤 Sending message: {...}
📥 Response status: 201
